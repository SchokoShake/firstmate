# Merge a task's PR, recording pr= and any available pr_head= into
# state/<id>.meta first via bin/fm-pr-check.sh, so bin/fm-teardown.sh's
# landed-check has a PR reference to verify a squash merge against.
#
# Why this exists: the normal trigger for running fm-pr-check.sh is the crew's
# `done: PR <url> checks green` line, which no-mistakes only emits once its CI
# step turns green. Repos that intentionally run no CI on PRs (CI only on
# pushes to the default branch) never emit that line, so a merge performed by
# hand-running `gh-axi pr merge` - the common shape of a yolo-authorized merge -
# can skip the recording step entirely. Teardown then has nothing to look up for
# a squash-merge-then-delete-branch flow and false-refuses provably landed work.
# This script makes recording part of the merge itself, so it cannot be skipped
# by omission. Use it for every PR merge (captain-requested or yolo-authorized),
# in place of calling `gh-axi pr merge` directly.
#
# NO META: merge from the PR URL alone. Recording exists to serve a LATER
# teardown, so it is owed only while there is still a crew to tear down - and
# both halves of that debt are settled here. This script used to refuse outright,
# for two reasons that only hold while the meta does: to stop merging a PR the
# fleet never recorded, and to leave teardown a reference to verify a squash
# merge against. No meta means teardown has already run: the task is gone, so
# there is no landed-check left to serve and nothing left to record it into. The
# durable backlog is the record now (AGENTS.md section 10), which is where the
# board reads the url the captain merges from (bin/fm-logbook-compose.sh) - so
# by the time that url reaches this script the PR is recorded, not unknown.
#
# Recording is SKIPPED here rather than attempted: fm-pr-check.sh tolerates a
# missing meta, but it also arms state/<id>.check.sh, and only fm-teardown.sh
# removes that. Arming a merge poll for a task teardown has already swept would
# strand a check no teardown will ever clear again, reporting "merged" - of this
# very merge - on every watcher cycle, forever, to no one.
#
# gh-axi pr merge expects a PR number and --repo <owner>/<repo>; it does not
# parse a full https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/<n> URL. This script
# parses the URL and invokes gh-axi in the form it accepts.
#
# Merge method: defaults to --squash when the caller passes none of --squash,
# --merge, --rebase, or --method after the optional -- separator. An explicit
# caller method is never overridden.
# Extra args must not include --repo or -R because the repo is parsed from the
# PR URL.
#
# Usage: fm-pr-merge.sh <task-id> <pr-url> [-- <extra gh-axi pr merge args>]
